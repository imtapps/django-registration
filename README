1. Download the source

2. Run python bootstrap.py -d
   Note:
     - The -d command tells bootstrap to use distribute, easy_install's 
       successor
     - If you want to run your project with a different version of python
       than your default, specify that when you run the bootstrap command. 
       IE: python2.4 bootstrap.py -d

3. Run bin/buildout
   Note: This will get all your project's dependencies listed in your 
         setup.py file.

I took James Bennett's django-registration as a starting point and have
copied it almost completely. I'd recommend you use his version.
http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/overview

The biggest difference is that I stripped out some stuff I don't find
immediately beneficial to me (like the internationalization and backends)
and I implemented the views using class based views new in Django 1.3.
